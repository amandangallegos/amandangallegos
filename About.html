    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my page! My Name is Amanda Gallegos and I was born and raised in San Antonio.</p>
	  <p>I am a mother of 3 kids, 4 fur babies and a husband and I love my Full House!  In late 2018 I made a big career change and went from a Branch Manager of a Financial Instituion to working in our IT department as a Business Analyst. This was a HUGE change for me, however because I came from the Line of Business this move afforded me the opportunity to speak for the Lines of Busines and know what their pain points were in regards to our applications.  Since then I decided to take a leap and go back to school to start Web Design.</p>
	  <p>This move has been an adjustment and going back to school has as well, however I am taking it by the horns and ready to take on this challenge.  Prior to changing my major, I loved photography and would do it on the side just for me to show my artistic side.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>I hope you enjoy seeing some of my work and look forward to hearing for you on your thoughts or words of encouragement!</p>
